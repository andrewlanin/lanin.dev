# Modern IDE concept

*{{ page.date | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }}*

If have written any code during past 40 years, chances are you did it in an environment that looks somewhat like this:

![Window split in two areas: file system tree and code editor](#)

Being a software development myself, I've used different editors and programming environments through my career: from minimalist vim configurations to heavy-weight IDEA distributions. Yet general layout of screen work space is always similar: big editor window and file system navigation panel to switch between files. Despite looking so familiar and natural, these days I find it outdated and counter-productive.

## File hierarchy is irrelevant

## Editing one file at a time is inefficient

## Chunks enable all sorts of visualisations

## Chunks are not bound to text-only

## Canvas should be persisted in code repository
