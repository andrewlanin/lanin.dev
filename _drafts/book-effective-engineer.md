# The Effective Engineer, Edmond Lau

For the past few years reading became quite a persistent habit of mine. Was not much of a reader before, but at some point thirst for an engineering wisdom pushed me into a wonderful world of non-fiction literature. At first I was doing just that: reading. Then I started to flag most interesting parts of books I read with pencil and bookmarks in case I decide to review it later. But after that I realized, those scattered breadcrumbs I left for myself just in case, will hardly make any sense in a little while when now-fresh memories will fade into non-existence. What's the solution? Writing a short essay for each piece, I guess. So here we go, clumsy book reviews and random notes from a tech guy with terrible English. Enjoy!

The Effective Engineer by Edmond Lau despite having a terrible cover design was not a waste of time. Quite the opposite. Upon being finished, the book left me in a state of lightweight self-analysis. Do I spend my working hours right? Does the result worth the effort? Do I even deserve that corporate title of a senior engineer? Good questions, Andrew, good questions.

Central topic of the book is so called «leverage framework», decision making strategy which favors activities that produce more value in less amount of time. Pretty obvious, right? You bet! Chapters of the book depict various high-leverage activities that suppose to make positive impact on personal or collective productivity, but instead often neglected by participants. Those activities include, but not limited to:
- learning your tools;
- prioritizing tasks;
- setting up process with high iteration speed;
- measuring what you try to improve;
- validating ideas with prototypes;
- improving estimation skills;
- balancing quality with pragmatism;
- reducing operational overhead;
- building recruiting pipeline and onboarding process.

Most of the listed concepts was not really unexpected or eye-opening for me personally. Do I doubt importance of best-effort time estimation or keeping track of important business metrics? Not at all. But between knowing about a useful technique and successfully implementing it often lies abyss. This book was a solid reminder that many of those well-known high-leverage activities are yet to be integrated in my day-to-day life.

## Notes

- It is helpful to be familiar with at least one scripting language. It can be used to automate tedious process or to quickly prototype new system (p. 34).

- When evaluating task, it might be worth it to assume its impact on core business metric (percent, order of magnitude): 0.1, 1, 10 or 100 and time it will take to be implemented: hours, days, weeks or months. It helps to select tasks with most leverage to be done first (p. 45).

- Growth dynamics of a metric is often more important than its value (p. 84).

- Good metric must be *responsive*, that is be updated quickly to give a feedback, and *robust* enough that external factors outside of team control does not introduce much noise (p. 93).

- Rewriting existing software from scratch is one of the most risky activities and rarely results in success. It's better to do incremental rewrites with well-defined scope of each step (p. 141, 146).

- When processing data it's always preferable to use single fat machine over cluster due to coordination and management overheads of distributed systems (p. 179).

- There are two types of automation: automating mechanics and automating decision making. First one is usually straightforward and produces meaningful value immediately. Second is often hard to implement right (p. 186).

- When interviewing candidates, one should aim for the questions with highest signal-to-noise ratio. And kind signal interviewer is looking for depends on company values which should be formed beforehand. Interviewing practices from different companies might not work as they might look for different qualities in people (p. 198).
