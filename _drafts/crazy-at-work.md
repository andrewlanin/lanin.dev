## Quotes

> ...when you think of the company as a product, you ask different questions: Do people who work here know how to use the company? Is it simple? Complex? Is it obvious how it works? What's fast about it? What's slow about it? Are there bugs? What's broken that we can fix quickly and what's going to take a long time.

> What's our market share? Don't know, don't care. It's irrelevant. Do we have enough customers paying us enough money to cover our costs and generate a profit? Yes. Is that number increasing every year? Yes. That's good enough for us. Doesn't matter if we're 2 percent of the market or 4 percent or 75 percent. What matters is that we have a healthy business with sound economics that work for us. Costs under control, profitable sales.

> The business world is suffering from ambition hyperinflation. It's no longer about simply making a great product or provide a great service. No, now it's all about how this BRAND-NEW THING CHANGES EVERYTHING. A thousand revolutions promised all at once. Come on.

> The best information you'll ever have about a decision is at the moment of execution.

> A fractured hour isn't really an hour -- it's a mess of minutes. It's really hard to get anything meaningful done with such crummy input. A quality hour is 1x60, not 4x15. A quality day is at least 4x60, not 4x15x4.

> Being productive is about occupying your time -- filling your schedule to the brim and getting as much done as you can. Being effective is about finding more of your time unoccupied and open for other things besides work.

> "But how do you know if someone's working if you can't see them?" Same answer as this question: "How do you know someone's working if you *can* see them?" You don't. The only way to know if work is getting done is by looking at the actual work. That's the boss's job. If they can't do that job, they should find another one.

> Whenever executives talk about how their company is really like a big ol' family, beware. They're usually not referring to how the company is going to protect you no matter what or love you unconditionally. You know, like healthy families would. Their motive is rather more likely to be a unidirectional form of sacrifice: yours.

> It's especially tempting to think that if you work in a small company, you could benefit from someone with the experience from a big company to help you "grow up." But trying to teach a small company how to act like a big one rarely does anyone any good. You're usually better of finding someone who's familiar with the challenges at your company's size or thereabouts.

> Have you heard about those companies whose benefits include game-console rooms, cereal snack bars, top-chef lunches and dinners, nap rooms, laundry service, and free beer on Fridays? It seems so generous, but there's also a catch: You can't leave the office.

> Open-plan offices suck at providing an environment for calm, creative work done by professionals who need peace, quite, privacy, and space to think and do their best.

> If you don't clearly communicate to everyone else why someone was let go, the people who remain at the company will come up with their own story to explain it. Those stories will almost certainly be worse than the real reason.

> Following group chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda. It's completely exhausting.

> If everyone needs to see it, don't chat about it. Give the discussion a dedicated, permanent home that won't scroll away in five minutes.

> We don't want reactions. We don't want first impressions. We don't want knee-jerks. We want considered feedback. Read it over. Read it twice, three times even. Sleep on it. Take your time to gather and present your thoughts -- just like a person who pitched the original idea took their timr to gather and present theirs.

> We want our teams to be able to glide by one another independently rather than get tripped up in lockstep. Things should fit together rather than stick together. Dependencies are angled, intertwined teams, groups or individuals that can't move independently of one another. Whenever someone is waiting on someone else, there's dependency in the way.

> You just can't being your A game to every situation. knowing when to embrace Good Enough is what gives you the opportunity to be truly excellent when you need to be. We're not suggesting you put shit work there. You need to be able to be proud of it, even if it's only "okay." But attempting to be indiscriminately great at everything is a foolish of energy.

> It's almost impossible to work on something and not be tempted to chase all the exciting new what-if and we-could-also ideas that come up. There's always one more thing it could do, one more improvement it should have. But if you actually want to make progress, you have to narrow as you go.

> What counts as best practice for a company of 10000 is very rarely so for a company of 10. ... And it's not just about a difference in size, it's a difference in everything. Are you selling a service for a recurring fee or a product for a onetime cost? Different practices. Are you just designing for a single awesome iPhone app or are you trying to reach Android, the web, and email as well? Different practices. Are you building your company to last, or are you starting with an exit strategy in mind? Different practices. Have your people worked together for a long time, or are you building a brand-new team from scratch? Different practices.

> What's more, best practices imply that there's single answer to whatever question you're facing. It implies that you really don't have a choice in the matter. Resist the implication. You always have a choice.

> ...rather than jumping on every new idea right away, we make every idea wait a while. Generally a few weeks, at least. That's just enough time either to forget about it completely or to realize you can't stop thinking about it.

> Until you're running a profitable business, you're always almost out of business. You're racing the runway. Fretting about whether you'll take off in time. Worrying about how to make payroll at the last moment if you don't.

> We've rejected the per-seat business model from day one. It's not because we don't like money, but because we like freedom more! The problem with per-seat pricing is that it makes your biggest customers your best customers. With money comes influence, if not outright power. And from that flows decisions about what and who to spend time on. There's no way to be immune from such pressure once the money is flowing. The only fix is to cap the spigot.

> ...copying does more harm to the copier than to be copied. When someone copies you, they are copying a moment in time. They don't know the thinking that went into getting you to that moment in time, and they won't know the thinking that'll help you have a million more moments in time. They're stuck with what you left behind.

> ...people are usually in the middle of something that's more important to *them* than a change to *your* product. They're already invested in what they have to do and they're already familiar with how they're going to do it. And then you toss a change at them that immediately makes their life a little more complicated. Now they have a new thing to learn right in the middle of having an old thing to do.
