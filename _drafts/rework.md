## Quotes

> You have the most information when you're doing something, not before you've done it. Yet when do you write plan? Usually it's before you've even begun. What's the worst time to make a big decision.

> Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service. ... When you don't know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious.

> Anyone who takes a "we'll fire out how to profit in the future" attitude to business is being ridiculous. That's like building a rocket ship but starting off by saying, "Let's pretend gravity doesn't exist." A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby.

> When you start anything new, there are forces pulling you in variety of directions. There's the stuff you *could* do, the stuff you *want* to do, and the stuff you *have* to do. The stuff you *have* to do is where you should begin. Start at the epicenter.

> When we start designing something, we sketch  out ideas with a big, thick Sharpie marker, instead of ballpoint pen. Why? Pen points are to fine. They're too high-resolution. They encourage you to worry about thing that you shouldn't worry about yet, like perfecting the shading or whether to use a dotted or dashed line. You end up focusing on things that should still be out of focus.

> You want to get into rhythm of making choices. When you get in that flow of making decision after decision, you build momentum and boost morale. Decisions are progress. Each one you make is a brick in your foundation. You can't build on top of "We'll decide it later," but you *can* build on top of "Done."

> The core of your business should be built around things that won't change. Things that people are going to want today *and* ten years from now. Those are the things you should invest in.

> ...when you do collaborate, try to use passive communication tools, like e-mail, that don't require an instant reply, instead of interrupting ones, like phone calls and face-to-face meetings. That way people may respond when it's convenient for them, instead of being forced to drop everything right away.

> If you decide you absolutely *must* get together, try do make your meeting a productive one by sticking to these simple rules:
> - Set a timer. When it rings, meeting is over. Period.
> - Invite as few people as possible.
> - Always have a clear agenda.
> - Begin with a specific problem.
> - Meet at the site of the problem instead of a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes.
> - End with a solution and make someone responsible for implementing it.

> Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. Judo solutions are all about getting the most out of doing the least. Whenever you face an obstacle, look for a way to judo it. Part of this is recognizing that problems are negotiable. Let's say your challenge is to get a bird's-eye view. One way to do it is to climb Mount Everest. That's the ambitious solution. But then again, you could take an elevator to the top of a tall building. That's a judo solution.

> The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.

> What distinguishes people who are ten times more effective than the norm is not that they work ten times as hard; it's that they use their creativity to come up with solutions that require one-tenth of the effort.

> Keep breaking your time frames down into smaller chunks. Instead of one twelve-week project, structure it as twelve one-week projects. Instead of guesstimating at tasks that take thirty hours or more, break them down into more realistic six-to-ten-hour chunks. Then go one step at a time.

> If you're planning to build "the iPhone killer" or "the next Pokemon," you're already dead. You're allowing the competition to set the parameters. You're not going to out-Apple Apple. They're defining rules of the game. And you can't beet someone who's making the rules. You need to redefine the rules, not just build something slightly better.

> When you let customers outgrow you, you'll most likely wind up with a product that's basic -- and that's fine. Small, simple, basic needs are constant. There's an endless supply of customers who need exactly that. And there are always more people who are not using your product than people who are. Make sure you make it easy for these people to get on board. That's where your continued growth potential lies.

> ...let your latest grand ideas cool off for a while first. By all means, have as many great ideas as you can. Get excited about them. Just don't act in the heat of the moment. Write them down and park them for a few days. Then, evaluate their actual priority with a calm mind.

> As a business owner, you should share everything you know. This is anathema to most in the business world. Businesses are usually paranoid and secretive. They think they have proprietary this and competitive advantage that. Maybe a rare few do, but most don't. And those that don't stop acting like those that do. Don't be afraid of sharing.

> Trade the dream of overnight success for slow, measured growth. It's hard but you have to be patient. You have to grind it out. You have to do it for a long time before the right people notice.

> You need an environment where everyone feels safe enough to be honest when things get tough. You need to know how far you can push someone. You need to know  what people really mean when they say something. So hire slowly. It's the only way to avoid winding up at a cocktail party of strangers.

> ...being a good writer is about more than writing. Clear writing is a sign of clear thinking. Great writers know how to communicate. They make things easy to understand. They can put themselves on someone else's shoes. They know what to omit. And those are qualities you want in any candidate.

> Instead of thinking about how you can land a roomful of rock stars, think about the room instead. We're all capable of bad, average, and great work. The environment has a lot more to do with great work than most people realize.

> Don't create a policy because one person did something wrong once. Policies are only meant for situations that come up over and over.

> Write to be read, don't write just to write. Whenever you write something, read it out loud. Does it sound the way it would if you were actually talking to someone? If not, how can you make it more conversational.

> There are four-letter words you should never use in business: *need*, *must*, *can't*, *easy*, *just*, *only*, and *fast*.
