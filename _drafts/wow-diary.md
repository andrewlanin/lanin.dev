## Quotes

> I was midway through building a tower called Karazhan, using an editor called Radiant, software that many of the FPS games used to build their 3D levels. Radiant was developed by id Software.

> Everyone in the company played games, from CEO down to our receptionist. We even turned away qualified programmers who didn't play games.

> Kevin [Beardslee] was experienced and design-savvy enough to encapsulate what Team 2 wanted to make -- a Warcraft version of EverQuest. Kevin envisioned Quake-style WASD keyboard controls, instanced dungeons, and clear quest indicators to make the MMO experience attractive to casual players.

> Allen Adham and the rest of the designers were particularly excited about a community simulation game called *Animal Crossing*. It gave birth to the idea of synchronizing our WoW's day/night cycles to Earth's sidereal time, meaning all in-game day lasted 24 hours. It spurred discussions about the merit of making players wait for rewards, and that anticipation could be an aspect of both immersion and player retention.

> ...the procedurally created dungeons employed by AO [Anarchy Online] were immediately popular  with the game designers, who declared that WoW interior levels should follow AO direction. It was decided an infinite number of generic dungeons would be better than a smaller number of unique ones, sacrificing flavour for quantity.

> ...lore is never critical to a game's survival. ... Computer game stories aren't difficult to write at all. Not even remotely. Writing stories is so easy it seems nearly half the people in the industry want to do it.

> Games require obvious plotlines and archetypal characters because the audience doing several things at once. There is cacophony of preoccupying issues, so it's unrealistic to expect players to follow a detailed storyline or subtle hints. Storytellers in the environment must wield blunt instruments.

> When players say they love a game's story, what they usually mean is they enjoy the immersion. An immersive environment allows for easy escapism and there are many contributing factors, the least important of which is the story. Games like *Half-Life* are famous for their "stories," yet narratives aren't particularly unique. What people liked in *Half-Life* was the believability of the game's creature behaviour, non-linear problem solving, open level design, and reactive environment. Providing players with satisfying feedback to their actions connects them to the gameworld.

> No one, including our own dev team, guessed our design leads would create difficult raids -- not until Onyxia and the Molten Core playtests surfaced years later.

> Economization of features was another successful philosophy. We wouldn't roll features or functionality into our games just to have more bullet points on our game's box. We only implemented features that could be reused for other types of gameplay and avoided dead-end ideas.

> After doing the ECTS demonstrations, the producers and game designers reevaluated the size of Azeroth. They felt the cross-continental run was too short since it took about ten minutes to traverse. The designers, producers and exterior level designers sat down to talk about what could be done. They reached a decision to divide the continent vertically down the center and double its width. Most zones became bigger, and vertical zones like Stranglethorn became gigantic.

> Good MMO designers pursue ideas that establish fertile groundwork for content creation, not gimmicks or twists that set their game apart.

> NCSOFT was using the Unreal II engine, a solution Blizzard had investigated and decided was unsuitable for an MMO because of poor frame rate on low-end systems.

> The EQ team had confided that their subscription numbers went up every time a competing product came out. Everyone checking out a new MMO had opened up more customers to the concept of subscriptions -- and when the new game flopped, the user base migrated to *EverQuest*. Competition was good for games. The fallacy about competing products probably came from movie industry, where films have only two weekends of revenue. But time and time again, games in the same genre coexisted.

> Wariness of marketing came from watching sales-people ruin other studios. Some behaved like sharks, eating companies from inside out, schmoozing their way into decision-making position where they didn't belong.

> Blizzard North was busy making soon-to-be-canceled game called "Dragons" as well as Diablo III.

> Many of the top Magic: The Gathering players were migrating to Texas Hold 'Em since the game was easier and good players could win much more than a box of trading cards.

> If there is a place where players can exploit gaining experience, items, currency, or reputation, than that's precisely what players will do, because they always take the path of least resistance. Since MMO content is measured in months, not hours, the content is paradoxically daunting, so any shortcut to the top will become the most popular route, even if it isn't fun. And if a game's path of least resistance isn't fun, it means the game isn't fun.

> There are millions of invisible bunnies in *World of Warcraft*. If a monster lobbed lightning bolts at a specific location, chances were they were targeting invisible rabbits. Quest designers and monster scripters used them as the default target for just about everything from the depths of the Molten Core to the holiday events in Stormwind.

> The presence of an experience bar was debated, since wanted the player to have fun without focusing too much on leveling.

> Orange Country restaurants were accustomed to seating groups of people wearing Blizzard T-shirts. (The older Blizzard T-shirts were cooler because it meant you were more of a veteran.) Waiters familiar with our games asked if we worked sixteen-hour days or what project we were part of. Often they told us they liked our games or rambled on about their Diablo character.

> We learned only after shipping WoW that players really liked short dungeon runs, and so the Scarlet Monastery's "wing approach" was the direction taken by subsequent expansions.

> ...Blizzard employees only distantly knew we were working on "something famous." We'd either gotten used to or forgotten our worldwide renown. To us game development was still a job, a personal passion, and we were more focused on life's stupid things like where the producers were going to order our dinner.

> John Yoo was the game's item designer, promoted from QA to WoW design team. He once lamented how his job entailed mere data entry because wowedit couldn't import item values from Excel. "Every day I only have time to enter the new damage values. That's all I do. I match damage values to the combat equations the programmers tweaked only the day before. Tomorrow, they'll tweak them again, and I'll have to input all the numbers in every single weapon. This has been going on for weeks and weeks. I don't even have time to make anything cool or think about balancing. If the game could read data from Excel, I wouldn't have to waste all my time inputting these values whenever someone changes combat equations.

> Another issue holding WoW back was the game didn't allow for Diablo-style point-and-click movement, which was important because it freed up the player's hand to hold a cigarette.

> Without meetings, concepts, or producer's approval, I created the easiest dungeon I'd ever built in only a week -- the Molten Core. I was a little embarrassed about how simple the geometry was. I sculpted the bulk of the layout in a couple of days, and spent a few more applying textures.
