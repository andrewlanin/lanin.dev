## Quotes

> ...you're shouldn't hire people you don't trust, or work for bosses who don't trust you. If you're not trusted to work remotely, why are you trusted to do anything at all? If you're held in such low regard, why are you able to talk to customers, write copy for an ad, design the next product, assess insurance claims, or do tax returns?

> Culture isn't football table. It's not a paintball outing in the forest. It's not even Christmas party where Steve got so drunk that everyone had a good story for the rest of the year. That's people hanging out and having a good time. No, culture is the spoken and unspoken values and actions of the organization.

> Sunk cost means that the money spent on the office is already spent. Whoever paid for it is not getting it back whether it's being used or not. So, rationally, the only thing that matters regarding where to work is whether the office is a more productive place or not.

> ...be mindful of language barriers. With remote work, most communications is written. Many people who can get by with so-so language skills in the spoken realm fall flat when it comes to the written word. There simply isn't much room for weak communication on teams with tight collaboration. You need solid writers to make remote work work, and a solid solid command of your home language is key.

> The old adage still applies: No assholes allowed. But for remote work you need to extend it to no asshole-y behavior allowed, no drama allowed, no bad vibes allowed.

> Being a good writer is an essential part of being a good remote worker. When most arguments are settled over email or chat or discussion bard, you'd better show up equipped for the task. So, as a company owner or manager, you might as well filter for this quality right from the get-go.

> You should read, read, and read some more. Study how good writers make their case. Focus on clarity first, style second.

> We don't believe in asking people to solve puzzles. Solving real problems is a lot more interesting -- and enlightening.

> The job of a manager is not to herd cats, but to lead and verify work. The trouble with that job description is that it requires knowledge of the work itself. You can't effectively manage a team if you don't know the intricacies of what they're working on.

> If the company is full of people whom nobody trusts to make decisions without layers of managerial review, then the company is full of the wrong people.

> So instead of trying to treat motivation as something that can be artificially ginned up with just the right tricks, treat it as a barometer of the quality of work and the work environment. If a worker's motivation is slumping, it's probably because the work is weakly defined or appears pointless, or because others on the team are acting like tools.
