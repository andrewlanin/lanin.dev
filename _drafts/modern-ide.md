# Modern IDE concept

If have written any code during past 40 years, chances are you did it in an environment that looks somewhat like this:

![Window split in two areas: file system tree and code editor](#)

Being a software development myself, I've used different editors and programming environments through my career: from minimalist vim configurations to heavy-weight IDEA distributions. Yet general layout of screen work space is always similar: big editor window and file system navigation panel to switch between files. Despite looking so familiar and natural, these days I find it outdated and counter-productive.

## File hierarchy is irrelevant

When we think about navigating project source code with whatever intent, we think about browsing through its directories and files. But what exact role does file concept play when applied to source code? It's a storage! Just a method to put program code on a hard drive, nothing more, nothing less. Do we really need to worry about underline persistence mechanic that much to put the file tree on such a spotlight in out development environment. I think not.

## Editing one file at a time is inefficient

## Chunks enable various visualisations

## Chunks are not bound to text-only content

## Canvas should be persisted in code repository
